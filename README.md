MMVE
====

  Mass MV Edit: use your editor to move (rename) files.


TODO
----

* Recurse directories:
  - `-r some_dir` will rename `some_dir` entries.
    `somedir/` could also be used
  - `-rr some_dir` will rename all files found recursively in
    `some_dir`

* Handle conflicts in edited files

* Make EDITOR configurable in the API, keep ENV['EDITOR'] as default.

* Sort entries
